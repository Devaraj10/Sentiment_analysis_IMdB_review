# Sentiment_analysis_IMdB_review
## A project in Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program implemented using AWS SageMaker.

### Project Overview
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project I will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, will deploy my model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
